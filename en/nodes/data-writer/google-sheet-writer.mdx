### Node Input

- `headers` (dictionary): Defines the structure of columns in the Google Sheet. Each key corresponds to a field, and each value includes a `label` representing the column name.
- `spreadsheetUrl` (string): The URL of the Google Spreadsheet where data will be written.
- `spreadsheetId` (string): The ID of the Google Spreadsheet.
- `spreadsheetName` (string): The name of the spreadsheet.
- `sheetName` (string): The specific sheet within the spreadsheet where data will be inserted.
- `userEmail` (string): The email address of the Google account authorized to access the spreadsheet.

### Node Output

This node completes without returning a specific output value, confirming that data was successfully added to the specified Google Sheet.

### Function

The GoogleSheetWriter node writes data to a designated Google Sheet according to the column headers and structure specified in the `headers` input. It authenticates using OAuth2 to obtain access tokens, then uses these credentials to add rows to the sheet. Each headerâ€™s label serves as a column name, with the corresponding values acting as data to be inserted. This node supports automated data entry, facilitating both single-row and multi-row data insertion.

### When to Use It?

The GoogleSheetWriter node is particularly useful for:

- Automating data entry into Google Sheets
- Updating records or adding new entries
- Logging data in a structured format within specific sheets
