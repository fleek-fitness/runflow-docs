### Node Input

- `input1`, `input2`, ...: Individual input text values to be combined. Each input is named in the format `input1`, `input2`, etc., and corresponds to different parts of the text that will be merged according to the specified format.

### Node Output

- `combined_text`: The final text result created by combining the inputs according to the specified format.

### Function

The TextCombiner node takes multiple text inputs and combines them into a single formatted output string. The combination format is specified by the user and can include placeholders like `{input1}`, `{input2}`, etc., to indicate where each input should be inserted within the final text.

### When to Use It?

The TextCombiner node is particularly useful when:

- Creating standardized messages
- Formatting reports with multiple text inputs
- Merging inputs into a cohesive output for structured formats
