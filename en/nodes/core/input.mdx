### Node Inputs

The Input node is where your flow begins, letting you take in data from a variety of sources.

#### Node Outputs

- `input` (any): This can be any type of data coming from the Input node, determined by the source.

### Node Functionality

The Input node acts as the gateway for bringing data into your flow. It can take in information from several origins, such as:

- User inputs
- API calls
- Database queries
- File uploads
- Webhook payloads
- Scheduled events

Once received, this data is ready for further actions in the subsequent nodes of your flow.

### When To Use

You should use the Input node when you need to:

- Kick off a flow with data from outside sources
- Activate a flow based on particular events or criteria
- Collect user inputs or handle API requests
- Bring external data into your workflow for processing

### Examples

Some scenarios where you might use the Input node include:

1. Gathering user input through a chat interface
2. Processing webhook payloads to automate workflows
3. Bringing in data from a CSV file for flow processing
4. Starting a flow triggered by a scheduled event

<Info>
  The specific settings for configuring the Input node will depend on your platform and the type of input you're dealing with.
