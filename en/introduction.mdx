## Welcome to the Runflow Community ðŸ‘‹

If you're keen on building powerful automation without writing code, you've come to the right place. Runflow provides an intuitive and collaborative platform where you can create AI-based workflow automation (we call them 'Flows') using modular components known as nodes.

## Key Features

## Terminology

- **Node**: Modular components that you can drag and drop onto the canvas, similar to no-code Lego pieces.
- **Flow**: A series of connected nodes to achieve a specific goal, like a no-code Lego creation.
- **Subflow**: Utilize other Flows within a larger Flow, allowing for simplification and modularity.

## What are Nodes?

Nodes are the building blocks of a Flow. Each node represents one step in a series toward your goal.

You can drag nodes from the menu onto the canvas, and the menu can be shown or hidden via icons.

Nodes typically accept inputs, produce outputs, and have parameters. Many of these properties can be optional.

## What is a Flow?

A Flow is at the heart of Runflow, enabling the connection of nodes to perform specific tasks.

Once a Flow is executed, data moves from one node to the next, with each node manipulating or generating content along the way.

## How to Build a Flow

The Flow creation page features a large canvas where you can design your personalized Flows. Each node can be found in the library on the left.

1. Drag nodes onto the canvas one by one.
2. Once placed on the canvas, they're ready to connect.
3. An input from one node is derived from the output of another.

## Flow Standard Format

Most Flows follow a general pattern: **Data Collection, AI Preparation, AI Processing, Output Results**

1. **Data Loader**: Typically starts with some form of data collection.
2. **Data Modifier**: These nodes are the backbone of the Flow, performing various data manipulation tasks.
3. **AI Usage**: Followed by nodes utilizing AI. These are the inference sources of the Flow.
4. **Data Creator**: Almost always the final stage of a Flow, interfacing with the outside world to convert AI-processed outputs into meaningful results.

## Starting with a Template

The best way to begin is by using pre-made templates.

Remember, the true power of the platform lies in personalization. Use templates as a starting point, then tailor them to suit your needs!

We've crafted over 60 functional Flows complete with annotations. Use these to understand how things work or to jump straight in.
