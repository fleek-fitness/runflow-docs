- `customDelimiter` (string): The delimiter to use when `mode` is `"custom"`.

### Node Output

### Functionality

The Text Splitter node divides the input text based on the criteria specified by the user. You can split text by sentence, newline, or a custom delimiter. This node makes it easier to process or analyze text by breaking it down into smaller units.

### When to Use?

The Text Splitter node is useful when you need to break down long text into smaller units. For example, you can use it to analyze each sentence of a document individually or process data line by line. Additionally, by using a custom delimiter, you can split text according to specific patterns, making it applicable to various text processing scenarios.
