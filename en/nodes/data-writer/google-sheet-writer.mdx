### Node Input

- `rowValue` (string or string[]): This represents the data that will be entered into each row of a spreadsheet. Multiple `rowValue` entries can be submitted, each being in the form of a single string or a list of strings. Each `rowValue` is logged into an individual row in the spreadsheet.

### Node Output

This node does not produce output, but instead performs the task of writing data to Google Sheets.

### Functionality

The GoogleSheetWriter node specializes in logging the provided data into a Google Sheet. Users are required to provide the URL of the spreadsheet and the sheet name, and the node will add data to that sheet. When multiple `rowValue` inputs are provided, each is written as a separate row in the spreadsheet. The node automates the process of setting up authentication and writing data to the spreadsheet using the Google API.

### When to Use It?

The GoogleSheetWriter node is particularly useful in situations like:

- Storing survey results or log data in Google Sheets
- Sharing and managing data with multiple users through Google Sheets
- Keeping data in Google Sheets continuously updated automatically
