// Make sure you have Node.js (version 19 or higher) installed before you proceed.

Step 1. Install Mintlify on your operating system:
```

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```
1. </CodeGroup>

Step 2. Head over to where the docs are located (where `mint.json` is) and execute the following command:
```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```
The documentation website is now accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

By default, Mintlify runs on port 3000. If you'd like to switch it up, just use the `--port` flag to set a different port. For instance, to run it on port 3333, use this command:
```bash
mintlify dev
```
You'll see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use:
```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

## Mintlify Versions

Every CLI is associated with a particular version of Mintlify. If your local site isn't matching the live version, consider updating your CLI.

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```
</CodeGroup>
