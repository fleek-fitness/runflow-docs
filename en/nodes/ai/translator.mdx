### Node Input

- `content` (string or string[]): This is the text to be translated. It can be provided as a single string or a list of strings.
- `targetLanguage` (string): This is the code of the language into which you want to translate. For example, 'en' for English and 'ko' for Korean.

### Node Output

- `text` (string or string[]): This is the translated text. It's the result of converting the input `content` into the `targetLanguage`. It can be returned as a single text or multiple texts.

### Features

The Translator node takes provided text and translates it into the user-specified language. You provide the text to be translated (`content`) and the target language (`targetLanguage`), and the node returns the accurately translated text in the specified language. It operates asynchronously, allowing multiple texts to be processed simultaneously.

### When To Use It?

The Translator node is particularly useful in the following scenarios:

- When a workflow requires multilingual support
- When users need to convert information provided in multiple languages into one specific language
- When automating multilingual translation tasks
- In any scenario where translation service is needed

### Examples

1. Translating user messages into the service language in a customer support chatbot
2. Translating articles from a multilingual news feed into a specific language
3. Converting multilingual product descriptions into a single language

  For accurate translations, it is recommended to integrate this with a reliable translation API or service.
