### Node Input

- `url` (string or string[]): The URL of the YouTube video to be transcribed. Accepts a single URL string or a list of URLs.
- `is_advanced` (boolean, optional): When set to true, enables advanced transcription mode, which includes downloading and processing the audio for higher quality transcription.

### Node Output

- `transcription` (string or string[]): The transcribed text of the video content. If multiple URLs are provided, the output includes a list of transcriptions corresponding to each URL.

### Function

The YoutubeTranscriber node retrieves and transcribes audio from specified YouTube videos. When `is_advanced` is enabled, the node processes the audio locally to enhance transcription quality. In basic mode, it uses YouTubeâ€™s auto-generated captions where available.

### When to Use It?

The YoutubeTranscriber node is useful for:

- Extracting text from spoken content in YouTube videos
- Converting video content into text for analysis or summarization
- Integrating transcriptions into text-based workflows

<Info>
  Enabling `is_advanced` can improve transcription accuracy but may increase processing time. Use it for videos
  requiring precise transcription.
