### Node Input

- `file` (file or file[]): This represents the file or list of files you wish to load.

### Node Output

- `file` (file or file[]): This includes the successfully loaded file or list of files.

### Functionality

The FileLoader node is responsible for downloading specified files and saving them to a local system. It automatically retrieves files using URLs provided in the input and saves them to the local path. The node can handle a single file or multiple files simultaneously and executes parallel file downloads within set concurrency limits.

### When to Use

The FileLoader node is useful in the following scenarios:

- When you need to download files from a remote server
- When you need to fetch external resources in a workflow
- When you need to process large volumes of files automatically
- When you need to handle many files simultaneously or automate large-scale file loading tasks

### Examples

1. Periodically downloading resources provided by an external API and saving them locally
2. Collecting distributed data from multiple servers and integrating it into a local environment
3. Automating the loading of large files before passing them to a specific node in the workflow

<Info>
  When using the FileLoader, keep in mind that the task might experience delays depending on network conditions and server response times, so plan your workflow accordingly.
