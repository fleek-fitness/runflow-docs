description: "A node that returns a user-defined input value for use in workflows."

### Node Input

- `value` (string): A text or string value defined by the user, which the node will return.

### Node Output

- `output` (string): Outputs the provided `value` exactly as it was input by the user.

### Function

The InputNode simply returns the user-provided value. It takes the input `value` and makes it available for reference by other nodes in the workflow. This node is ideal for passing predefined data that can be used across the workflow.

### When to Use It?

The InputNode is useful when you need to pass a user-defined input to other nodes. Itâ€™s particularly helpful for:

- Setting an initial input value
- Transferring specific data to other processes within a workflow

<Info>
  Use this node to initialize or propagate values across multiple nodes in your
  workflow.
